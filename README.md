**Synesthesia Lens**

Synesthesia Lens is a code-generated visualization of how Alexander Scriabin, a famous composer and pianist, perceived his synesthesia. As you enter the Synesthesia Lens, the audio from your microphone is translated into lines of color depending on each instance's frequency, sporadically appearing on the page.
