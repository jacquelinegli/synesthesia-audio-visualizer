            What is the 'Synesthesia Lens'?
        </p>
        <p>
            The Synesthesia Lens is a code-generated visualization of what synesthesia was for composer Alexander
            Scriabin. As you enter the Synesthesia Lens, the audio from your microphone is translated into lines of
            color mapped to each note of your audio, sporadically appearing on the page.
        </p>

            What is synesthesia?
        </p>
        <p>
            Synesthesia is an involuntary and automatic perception of a bodily sense when another bodily sense is
            stimulated. For example, some synesthetic people associate specific colors with specific words. For
            Scriabin, he saw notes as specific colors, such as C being red, A being light green, and B being light blue.
        </p>
        <p class="body-header-text">
            How does this work?
        </p>
        <p>
            This project uses P5.js and ML5.js to create the synesthetic visualization and HTML, CSS, and JS to create
            the website. You can view the source code here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Live audio data is taken in from the microphone and their frequencies are identified in real time via
            ML5.js. This frequency is categorized into one of the 12 distinct notes found in Western music, then mapped
            to the color Scriabin saw for that note. I used P5.js to display each instance of the audio as a colorful
            line that appears for an instant than fades slowly. </p>
        <p>
            Below is the mapping of notes to colors Scriabin had that I used:

            My name is Jacqueline Li. As of April 2023, I am a 5th year at Northeastern University studying computer
            science and design graduating
            in May. This project is my senior capstone—a culmination of the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired
            throughout my time in undergrad poured into one stand alone project.
