            What is the 'Synesthesia Lens'?
        </p>
        <p class="body-response-text">
            The Synesthesia Lens is a code-generated visualization of how Alexander Scriabin, a famous composer and
            pianist, perceived his synesthesia. As you enter the Synesthesia Lens, the audio from your microphone is
            translated into lines of color depending on each instance's frequency, sporadically appearing on the page.

            What is synesthesia?
        </p>
        <p class="body-response-text">
            Synesthesia is an involuntary and automatic perception of a bodily sense when another bodily sense is
            stimulated. For example, some synesthetic people associate specific colors with specific words. For
            Scriabin, he saw notes as specific colors, such as C being red, A being light green, and B being light blue.

                This project uses P5.js and ML5.js to create the synesthetic visualization and HTML, CSS, and JS to
                create
                the website. You can view the source code <a
                    href="https://github.com/jacquelinegli/synesthesia-audio-visualizer" target="_blank">here</a>.

                Live audio data is taken in from the microphone and their frequencies are identified in real time via
                ML5.js. This frequency is categorized into one of the 12 distinct notes found in Western music, then
                mapped
                to the color Scriabin saw for that note. I used P5.js to display each instance of the audio as a
                colorful
                line that appears for an instant than fades slowly. </p>
            <p>
                Below is the mapping of notes to colors Scriabin had that I used:

            My name is Jacqueline Li. As of April 2023, I am a 5th year student at Northeastern University studying
            computer
            science and design graduating
            in May. This project is my senior capstone—a culmination of the knowledge and skills I’ve acquired
            throughout my time in undergrad poured into one stand alone project.
